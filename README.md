A simple [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) starter project with separate src/dist directories and a few npm scripts.

This is the project layout I typically set up when starting a new Eleventy project.

## Install

Clone the repo and install npm dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/jevets/eleventy-starter.git new-project
cd new-project
yarn && yarn dev
```

## Notes

- Run `yarn dev` for local development server.
- Run `yarn build` to compile static output.
- Templates are in the `src` directory.
- Output gets compiled into the `dist` folder.
